2.0b1 (2012-12-04)
------------------

- Cleaned up a lot of stuff--made more readable, fixed formatting,
  fixed single letter variable names, improved comments, cleaned up
  setup.py, added README, added CHANGELOG

- Added a module for tests; only one test so far, but that's better than
  nothing!

- Changed expected graph structure to simple adjacency matrix:
  {u: {v: edge, ...}, ...}

- Added Graph type to make construction and de/serialization of graphs
  easier; it also serves as a template for custom graph types by
  encapsulating the expected graph structure

- Restructured package so algorithmic code is in separate module (not
  __init__) and __init__ just exports the public API

- Made the ``annex`` arg to find_path() and
  single_source_shortest_paths() optional

- Pass the current node as the first arg to cost functions

- Reenabled heuristic function (it was commented out); pass it the same
  args as cost function

- Return computed edge costs from single_source_shortest_paths as part
  of the predecessor list

- Return only the predecessor list from single_source_shortest_paths;
  don't return the dictionary of total costs of s to all v reached
  (XXX: Would it maybe be useful to return this? Especially for the case
  where no destination node is specified?)

- Removed infinity wonkiness from single_source_shortest_paths (see
  d89a851 for details; basically, sys.infinity was being used
  unnecessarily as a special sentinel value)

History
-------

Dijkstar was originally written in December of 2004, and hadn't changed
much between then and just recently. It was spun off from the byCycle
project (bycycle.org) in 2007.

For years I had been planning to switch byCycle over to NetworkX, but
I was busy with other things and byCycle languished. I found some free
time recently to make the switch, but I found that NetworkX didn't fully
serve my needs. (I also found that it takes a similar approach in its
graph implementations: they're just dictionaries.)

The feature I need that is missing from NetworkX is the ability to pass
a cost function into the path finding function (this is something that
byCycle relies on). NetworkX only works with precomputed costs.

I decided to go ahead and polish up Dijkstar and release it as possible
lightweight alternative to NetworkX for simple use cases.

I was inspired by NetworkX and added a simple Graph class that has
a stripped down version of NetorkX's graph API (add_edge, add_node).
I also added utility methods for dumping graphs to and loading them from
disk (using pickle).
