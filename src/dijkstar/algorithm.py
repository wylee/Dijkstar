``nodes``
    Nodes comprising the shortest path.

``edges``
    Edges comprising the shortest path.

``costs``
    Cost to traverse each edge in ``edges``. When a cost function is
    passed to :func:`find_path`, these will be *computed* costs, which

    (depends on the cost function and how it computes costs). When a

``total_cost``
    This is simply the sum of ``costs``. When a cost function is passed
    to :func:`find_path`, this will be the sum of the *computed* costs,

    ``graph``
        An adjacency list that's structured as a dict of dicts (see
        :class:`dijkstra.graph.Graph`). Other than the structure, no
        other assumptions are made about the types of the nodes or edges
        in the graph. If ``cost_func`` isn't specified, edges will be
        assumed to be values that can be compared directly (e.g.,
        numbers, or any other comparable type).

    ``s``
        Start node.

    ``d``
        Destination node. If ``d`` is not specified, the algorithm is
        run normally (i.e., the paths from ``s`` to all reachable nodes
        are found). If ``d`` is specified, the algorithm is stopped when
        a path to ``d`` has been found.

    ``annex``
        Another graph that can be used to augment ``graph`` without
        altering it.

    ``cost_func``
        A function to apply to each edge to modify its base cost. The
        arguments it will be passed are the current node, a neighbor of
        the current node, the edge that connects the current node to
        that neighbor, and the edge that was previously traversed to
        reach the current node.

    ``heuristic_func``
        A function to apply at each iteration to guide the algorithm
        toward the destination (typically) instead of fanning out. It
        gets passed the same args as ``cost_func``.

    ``debug``
        If set, return additional info that may be useful for debugging.

    Returns
        A predecessor map with the following form::

        If ``debug`` is set, additional debugging info will be returned
