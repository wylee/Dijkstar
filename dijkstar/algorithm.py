    ``graph``
        A simple adjacency matrix (see :class:`dijkstra.graph.Graph`).
        Other than the structure, no other assumptions are made about
        the types of the nodes or edges in the graph. As a simple
        special case, if ``cost_func`` isn't specified, edges will be
        assumed to be simple numeric values.

    ``s``
        Start node.

    ``d``
        Destination node. If ``d`` is not specified, the algorithm is
        run normally (i.e., the paths from ``s`` to all reachable nodes
        are found). If ``d`` is specified, the algorithm is stopped when
        a path to ``d`` has been found.

    ``annex``
        Another ``graph`` that can be used to augment ``graph`` without
        altering it.

    ``cost_func``
        A function to apply to each edge to modify its base cost. The
        arguments it will be passed are the current node, a neighbor of
        the current node, the edge that connects the current node to
        that neighbor, and the edge that was previously traversed to
        reach the current node.

    ``heuristic_func``
        A function to apply at each iteration to help the poor dumb
        machine try to move toward the destination instead of just any
        and every which way. It gets passed the same args as
        ``cost_func``.
